description: Structured campground fields (amenities/booking/fees/season) + agency policy registry — shipped 2026-09-14, phases 1/2/4 done, registry at 27 rows
metadata:

Structured-field project on `campgrounds.json`, started and largely built 2026-09-14.
Rules live in **`docs/campground-schema.md`** (read it first); this is only the status
and the things that are not written down there.

**Done:** schema vocabulary + deep-merge PUT + policy registry (`campground_schema.py`,
`campground_policies.json`); manage-form UI with tri-state selects; RV Life rating lifted
out of note prose into `rating` on 11,771 entries (`extract_rating.py`); rec.gov season
derivation (`recgov_calendar.py`); 27 registry rows covering 5,704 entries (44.7%) and 57.2%
of nights actually slept (`state:WV` added 2026-09-15).

**Map popup surfacing DONE 2026-09-14** (commit `95879c2`): verified and inherited chip
runs, the agency half attributed ("Typical for Indiana state parks") and withheld when
`_policy_label()` cannot name the agency; `resolve()` gained a per-group `inherited` key
list because group-level scope cannot split a `mixed` group; formatters shared with the
manage form in `static/campground-schema.js`. **The motivation is worth carrying forward:
phase 2 had emptied the RV Life rating out of note prose on 11,771 entries and the popup
renders the NOTE, so the pass made a published fact invisible.** Any extraction that moves
prose into a field owes the same debt — see doc §8.6.

**Not done:** the LLM extraction pass over note prose for amenities/season (doc phase 3);
Good Sam bulk match (phase 5); more registry rows (phase 6); map FILTERS and manage-table
sort on the new fields; the NL corridor search that started the whole thread (deliberately
tabled).

**Next, in the order that made sense on 2026-09-14:** map FILTERS on the new fields are
the natural follow-on now that the values are visible — doc §8.5 has the shape (extend the
legend/ownership control pattern), and §2.2 is what makes it non-trivial: an unknown value
must be SHOWN and flagged, never filtered out, or a 30%-populated field turns into a search
that quietly returns a tenth of the database. Anything the filter evaluates client-side has
to ride in the inline marker payload (§8.4), so keep it to a boolean or short enum — the
page is already ~1.9 MB gzipped. After that: phase 3 (LLM extraction over notes, must be
incremental like `day_rollups`), phase 5 (Good Sam bulk match), phase 6 (more rows).

**Priority came from joining `trips.json` against `campgrounds.json` by nights slept**,
not entry count — that is what put PA/MD/VA ahead of MI/CA. Re-run that join before
picking the next rows — **`./policy_priority.py`** (committed 2026-09-15, read-only, no
args) is that join, and doc §5 names it. **Two traps it exists to hold:** `is_home_stay()`
reads `stay["place"]`, which only `parse_trips()` materializes (raw `trips.json` records
give a silent False and 23 home nights in the denominator), and family-kind entries carry
no `ownership`, so 47 driveway nights land in a bogus bucket unless excluded.

**The nights signal is now spent, as of the 2026-09-15 run.** Every row above the best
remaining agency is `private:*` / `hipcamp:*` / `local:*`, which doc §5 says to leave alone,
and the agency rows left are at 2 nights or fewer: `state:MA` (2 nights, 22 entries),
`state:GA` (1, 53), then nothing. So the next rows should be picked on **entries** or on a
trip actually being planned — `state:OR` (55), `state:GA` (53), `provincial:MB` (53),
`state:OK` (52), `provincial:SK` (52) lead that ranking; 961 entries across 34 rows remain.

**Realistic ceiling is ~52%.** `local:*` rows are mostly dead ends (`local:IA` is 245
entries across 245 different counties); Suffolk County worked only because it genuinely
is one authority.

**Watch items — schema gaps deliberately left open**, each seen once and awaiting a
second instance before extending the vocabulary: Hither Hills' one-reservation-per-
household peak-season limit; Virginia's non-resident surcharge scaling by site type
($5 standard → $8 full hookup); BC's maximum stay being per calendar year rather than
per visit.

**WV is the third row that could not state a booking window** (after IA's contradicted
cutoff and PA's absent non-resident rate), and the first with NO published rates at all —
West Virginia puts every number inside its Inntopia booking engine and nothing on the web.
The pre-online brochures still served from `wvstateparks.com` are the trap: they describe
held-back FCFS sites and a two-days-prior cutoff the current system contradicts, and a
search engine will hand you both as current.

**Unresolved:** Iowa's two official pages contradict each other on the booking cutoff,
and its post-cutoff FCFS is uncorroborated — resolve by phone. Florida's site 403s
automated fetch so its row is `method: reported`, not verified.
